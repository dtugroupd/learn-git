# Learn Git

This is a small guide for getting started using git. It will cover the basic CLI commands. I don't expect the reader to necessarily use the CLI for using git, though commands should be easy translatable to the corresponding buttons in the UI.

## UI's for Git

If you prefer to use a GUI for git rather than the CLI, I can highly recommend using the one built in Rider and Webstorm. If you're using another IDE/editor, such as VS Code, you can either use the built-in for the basic functions (changing branches, staging, committing etc), or download one for the following git clients:

* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
* [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
* [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client)

## Basic Workflow

This section describes how you can start working on a task.

### Finding a task to work on

First step is to visit the group's current project. First visit [the project page](https://github.com/orgs/dtugroupd/projects) on Github. There will be a project for each release. The project whos name ends with ðŸ“… is the current. I.e. in the image below, `Release 1` is the current release.

Let's click on that, and find a task. Start by looking in the _High Priority_ column for a task assigned to you. If there are none, look in the _Backlog_ column. Otherwise find a task you would like to work on, and assign yourself to that issue. If someone else is on it already, coordinate with that person, to ensure you aren't making duplicate work. If you are unsure what to work on, ask someone in the group for a task.

When you picked a task, move the task to the _In Progress_ column, and start working.

### Before Working: branching

Open a terminal, or if you prefer GUI, your chosen git GUI. If you're using the terminal, cd to the directory.

You are now ready to do some work. Let's start of by making sure we are in the master branch, and that the branch is updated:

```bash
git branch
#Â if there isn't a * in front of master, checkout to master: git checkout master
git pull
```

Now that master is updated, we can checkout to a new branch. Generally `checkout` changes to a branch. If the branch doesn't exist (which it don't when you are starting on a new task), add the `-b` argument:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-git-guidance
```

We are now ready to do some actual work (code ðŸ’»)

### After Working: stage, commit, push

Let's check which files we have changed:

```bash
git status
```

![git status](assets/terminal_status.png)

We can see that files marked in <span style="color:red;">red</span> are _unstaged_. Files marked in <span style="color:green">green</span> are _staged_. Unstaged files will not be included in the commit, staged files will.

If I try to commit without having staged any files for commit, nothing will happen, as there is nothing to commit. I can add either a single file (`git add dir/file_to_stage.txt`), or everything at once (`git add -A`).

The above image shows that I have one _modified_ file and one _untracked_ directory. The modified file means that it is a file, that have previously been committed to the repository, but now have some new changes added to it. Untracked files/directories are completely new things that can be added. Let's add everything and check the status again:

```bash
git add -A
git status
```

We can not clearly see all the files that was added and modified. These files are now staged for commit, and will thus be included if I choose to commit. I can stage individual files if I want to only commit certain changes.

For committing the file, I can highly recommend to setup an editor for committing. I personally use VS Code:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code -w"
```

We can now commit our changes:

```bash
git commit
```
